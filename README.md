The metal knob requires the following parts from the Knob kit: bearing, magnets, PCB.
You also need one of each outerTop & outerBot (metal), innerTop & innerBot (3D printed).

Outer parts can be ordered from JLCCNC in your choice of metal. Upload outerTop.step and outerBot.step to get an instant quote.
Inner parts need to be 3D printed. 

Due to tolerances between printers, I have made the inner parts slightly smaller than the inner dimensions of the outer parts. This means it is not a press fit unless your printer is poorly calibrated. 
To secure the inner parts, you need to use glue. 
I recommend cyanoacrylate, because it's quick and if you need to disassemble for any reason, it easily pops off metal surfaces. Two part epoxy can be used for a more permanent bond.
